# Troubleshooting

Here are the most common problems encountered when installing and using
Exegol.

## Unable to connect to Docker

There are multiple checks to do to make sure Docker works properly.

:::tabs ::

=== Docker service

The Docker service must installed up and running.

- For Windows users: Docker Desktop for Windows must be up and
  running.
- For macOS users: Docker Desktop for Mac (or
  [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/)) must be up and running.

=== Docker permissions

Make sure the Docker permissions are consistent with the Exegol
permissions. For instance, if you need `sudo` rights to use Docker,
you'll most likely need `sudo` to run Exegol smoothly.

See [the Exegol install guidance](/wrapper/cli/install#_3-run-exegol-with-appropriate-privileges) to use
exegol correctly with sudo.

=== Docker socket

The following command can be used to see the docker socket that is
used by default: `docker context ls`.

- For [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/) users (on macOS), the "orb
  socket" must be used.
- For Docker Desktop users (macOS/Windows), the "Docker desktop
  socket" must be used.
- For Linux users, the default socket should work.

Switching context can be done with `docker context use <context>`. For
instance, switching from a Docker Desktop to OrbStack could be done
with `docker context use orbstack`.

=== Symbolic link

The following symbolic link must exist `/var/run/docker.sock` and
point to the correct socket. Below is an example of what it should
look like.

```  bash
(Host) ~ $ ls -la /var/run/docker.sock
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  daemon  38 Jul 28 09:02 /var/run/docker.sock -/Users/someuser/.orbstack/run/docker.sock
```

If the link does not exist, it could be created with the following
command
`ln -sf /Users/someuser/.orbstack/run/docker.sock /var/run/docker.sock`.
This is an example for [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/). The command
must be adapted to the user's context.

## X11 on non-Linux hosts

X11, or X Window System, is a graphical windowing system that provides a
framework for creating and managing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in
Unix-like operating systems.

X11 sharing between an Exegol container and a host allows a graphical
application running within the container to display its GUI on the
host's X11 server. This means you can run graphical applications in
Exegol containers and have them appear as if they were running directly
on the host machine. It enables the execution of GUI-based applications
in isolated containers while interacting with them through the host's
graphical interface.

For macOS users, XQuartz is needed. It's listed in the [install requirements](/wrapper/cli/install#requirements).

> [!NOTE]
> Exegol's wrapper automatically starts XQuartz on macOS hosts when
> needed. But if for some reason it gets manually closed by the users
> while a container is running, X11 sharing will not work. Restarting
> the container with `exegol restart <container>` will restart XQuartz
> automatically if needed.

## Docker download errors

### Rate limiting

When downloading Docker images, you may encounter rate limiting errors from Docker Hub. This happens when you exceed the anonymous pull rate limit, which is likely to occur if you're on a shared network where people pull lots of images from Docker Hub.

To resolve this, create a Docker Hub account and authenticate (`docker login`), and retry the failing command.

### Time synchronization

Docker image downloads may be time-sensitive. In the case of dual-boot
systems, it is common to experience time lags of a few hours.

To correct the problem, check that your computer's date and time are
correct.

### Disk space

`Docker Desktop` is a tool used for running Docker containers on
`Windows` and `macOS`. However, it uses a `virtual disk` to store Docker
images, containers, and volumes. The virtual disk used by Docker Desktop
is not dynamic; it has a fixed size, which by default is set to `64GB`.

<img src="/assets/troubleshooting/dd_default_disk_size.png"
class="align-center" alt="Docker Desktop default disk size" />


Exegol images can be quite large, with some reaching over `50GB`. This
can quickly exceed the available virtual disk space, even if your
physical disk still has free space. To resolve this issue, you need to
allocate more space to the Docker Desktop virtual disk.

To increase the `virtual disk size`, open Docker Desktop and go to
`Settings -> Resources -> Advanced`. Locate the `Virtual disk limit`
option and increase the allocated size. Make sure to choose a value that
provides enough space for your images and containers, such as `128GB` or
more depending on your needs.

Apply the changes and then `restart` Docker Desktop to ensure the new
configuration takes effect.

> [!WARNING]
> If you decide to `reduce the size of the virtual disk`, be aware that
> Docker Desktop will completely `delete the virtual disk image`. This
> action will remove all Docker images, containers, and volumes stored
> on the disk. Therefore, before reducing the disk size, make sure to
> back up any important data or export your Docker images to avoid data
> loss.

## CRLF errors on Windows

If you have cloned the Exegol repository on Windows, you may encounter
errors when launching your container, for example:

``` bash
/.exegol/entrypoint.sh: line 3: trap: SIGTERM : invalid signal specification
/.exegol/entrypoint.sh: line 4: $'\r': command not found
/.exegol/entrypoint.sh: line 5: syntax error near unexpected token $'{\r''
/.exegol/entrypoint.sh: line 5: function exegol_init() {
```

This is caused by the automatic addition of CRLF linefeed by Windows to
ensure compatibility. To correct this problem, simply disable this
feature on the Exegol repository and reload the file of the repository:

``` bash
cd ./Exegol
git config core.autocrlf false
git rm -rf --cached .
git reset --hard HEAD
```

## Environment externally managed

When installing exegol with `python3 -m pip install exegol` on modern
operating systems (Ubuntu 23.04 and higher, Debian 12 and higher, macOS
14+), you may encounter the following error:

``` 
This environment is externally managed
To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
install.

If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
sure you have python3-full installed.

If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more information.

hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.
```

As the error message suggests, this error occurs when you try to install
Python packages system-wide. To resolve this issue, you have two options :

:::tabs 

=== Recommended Methods

**Using pipx (Preferred)**

The recommended way to install Exegol is using `pipx`, which
automatically handles virtual environment creation:

``` bash
pipx install exegol
```

**Manual Virtual Environment**

Alternatively, you can create and manage a virtual environment
manually:

``` bash
python3 -m venv path/to/venv
source path/to/venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install exegol
```

=== Other Methods

> [!WARNING]
> The following methods are not recommended as they can lead to
> conflicts with system packages.

**User Site Installation**

Install in the user site directory:

``` bash
python3 -m pip install --user exegol
```

**System-wide Installation**

Override system restrictions (not recommended):

``` bash
python3 -m pip install exegol --break-system-site-packages
```

## TLS certificate verification issues

When using Exegol behind an enterprise proxy that performs TLS inspection, you may encounter certificate verification errors. This happens because the proxy's Certificate Authority (CA) is not automatically trusted by the system's truststore. This effectively prevents the wrapper from listing images (`exegol info`), activating a license, etc.

The error message raised by the wrapper may be: `TLS certificate verification failed while contacting Exegol servers`.

For detailed instructions on how to fix this issue, please refer to the Supabase discussions [#29935](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29935#discussioncomment-12050763) and [#35590](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/35590) which provide solutions for trusting the proxy's CA certificate.

A quick-fix may be to add the custom CA to Exegol's virtual env's certifi's CA bundle:

```bash
cat custom_ca.crt >> $(~/.local/pipx/venvs/exegol/bin/python -c "import certifi; print(certifi.where())")
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to trust the whole chain, if applicable

## Arsenal TIOCSTI requirement

The arsenal tool needs the `TIOCSTI` functionality enabled. A GitHub
issue exists to request an evolution:
<https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/arsenal/issues/77>.

This feature cannot be enabled only in exegol containers (docker
limitation), it must be configured in the host with the following
command:

``` bash
# For the current session
sudo sysctl -w dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti=1

# Persistent configuration (as root)
echo "dev.tty.legacy_tiocsti=1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```

For more information about installation, see the [installation section](/wrapper/cli/install).
