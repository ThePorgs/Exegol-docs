## Features

The Exegol wrapper has many features to automatically and transparently
manage different configurations to facilitate the use and creation of
docker containers.

### Desktop

<img src="/assets/desktop.png" class="align-center"
alt="Exegol Desktop Overview" />

On some systems, it may be difficult to have or share an X11
environment. Some users prefer to have a full graphical desktop
environment rather than just graphical applications.

To meet this need, Exegol is able to host a complete graphical
environment within its container since version `4.3.0` of the wrapper
and `3.1.2` of the images.

This environment can then be made available to others in a variety of
ways. The default protocol is currently **HTTP**, but the user can
change the configuration to use the **VNC** alternative.

This feature can be enabled manually with the option `--desktop` of the
[start action](./cli/start#options).

> [!TIP]
> The default behavior and configuration of the desktop mode can be
> changed in the [configuration of Exegol](/wrapper/features#exegol-configuration).

Desktop access is protected by **PAM authentication**. To log in, it is
essential to retrieve the login credentials and the **URL** where the
desktop is accessible. These details can be obtained from the
container's information, either at the time of container launch or by
using the following command :

``` bash
exegol info CONTAINER_NAME
```

```

```

### X11 sharing (GUI)

By default exegol configures the new container and host to allow the
execution to the display of graphical window launched from an exegol
container. This is achieved through X11 sharing.

For example, if bloodhound is launched in an exegol container, the
graphical window (GUI) will be displayed in the user's graphic
environment.

This feature can be disabled manually with the option `--disable-X11` of
the [start action](./cli/start#options).

### Workspace

Exegol always creates within a container a **persistent** workspace
(even after deleting the container) and **shared** with the host.

By default a folder will be created on the host and shared with the
container. This folder will be created in `~/.exegol/workspaces/` with
the name of the exegol container.

> [!TIP]
> The default location of workspace volumes can be changed in the
> [configuration of Exegol](/wrapper/features#exegol-configuration).

The user can also create an Exegol container with an **existing custom
workspace folder** (with already existing data) regardless of its
location in the file system.

See the options `-w WORKSPACE_PATH` and `-cwd` of the
[start action](./cli/start#options) for more details.

#### Update-fs

The root user is used by default in Exegol containers which poses
problems of permissions when accessing the project documents from the
host. To remedy this without compromising, a **shared permission
system** exists allowing the host user to have read and write access to
files created from the container.

This system is **automatically activated** when a **new** default
workspace is created.

> [!WARNING]
> When the user uses an existing custom folder as workspace, this system
> is **disabled** by default! This feature can be **enabled by default**
> by changing the `configuration of Exegol` of the [start action](./cli/start#options)
) but it will lead to the
> **modification** of the folder and its sub-folders **permissions** (as
> `g+rws`).
>
> If the user does not have the rights to perform such an operation, a
> **sudo command** will be proposed to the user that he will have to
> **execute manually** to apply the necessary permissions for the proper
> functioning of the functionality (as `chgrp` + `g+rws`).

> [!TIP]
> When the default configuration of this feature is changed and the
> update will be **enabled by default**, the option `--update-fs` can
> still be used to manually **disable** the feature in specific cases.

### OpenVPN connection

Exegol supports OpenVPN tunnel configuration to **automatically**
establish a VPN tunnel at container **startup**.

Exegol supports **certificate authentication** but also **user/password
authentication** through an authentication file (to allow
non-interactive and transparent authentication) with an additinal
parameter.

When preparing your VPN configuration file:

- All files (CA, user cert, user Key, etc) should preferably be included
  in a single `.ovpn` file, otherwise a dedicated folder must be
  prepared (cf. next tip)

> [!TIP]
> A folder can also be used in the case of a **multi-file
> configuration** (with **relative** paths!) and the configuration file
> must have the `.ovpn` extension (Only **one** .ovpn file will be
> loaded by exegol). For example, the directory structure:
>
> ``` 
> . my_vpn/
> |- configuration.ovpn => This file contains the OpenVPN configuration with relative path to the various external files
> |- root_ca.pem => Certificat Authority file referenced as `./root_ca.pem` in configuration.ovpn
> |- my_user.crt => User's personal certificate file referenced as `./my_user.crt` in configuration.ovpn
> |- my_user.key => User's personal key file referenced as `./my_user.key` in configuration.ovpn (password protected file are not supported for non-interactive logon)
> ```
>
> And the exegol wrapper command: `exegol start --vpn ./my_vpn`

- If you're using a login / password authentication, prepare an **auth
  file** to enable passive authentification with Exegol (See the option
  `--vpn-auth VPN_AUTH`)
- Password protected certificate keys are **not supported** for passive
  authentification
- Once the container is created, you **cannot move or rename** your VPN
  configuration file
- If you want to **update your VPN configuration**, you can update the
  same `.ovpn` file on your host and restart the container with
  `exegol restart`
- If you want your Exegol container to automatically update its **DNS**
  configuration according to the **VPN server** settings, add this
  configuration to your `.ovpn` file:

``` 
script-security 2
up /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf
down /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf"
```

See the options `--vpn VPN` and `--vpn-auth VPN_AUTH` of the
[start action](./cli/start#vpn) for more details.

> [!TIP]
> In the case of a problem, to troubleshoot a VPN connection, OpenVPN
> logs can be retrieved within the container in the file
> `/var/log/exegol/vpn.log`.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to create a container that is able to start **VPN
> manually**, you can create your container with the following
> parameters: `exegol start --vpn ''`

### WireGuard VPN <Badge type="pro" /> <Badge type="enterprise" />

Exegol supports WireGuard VPN tunnel configuration to **automatically**
establish a VPN tunnel at container **startup** (since Exegol images version `3.1.8`).

To configure a WireGuard VPN, your configuration file must have the `.conf` extension.

See the options `--vpn VPN.conf` of the [start action](./cli/start#vpn) for more details.

> [!NOTE] Troubleshooting
> WireGuard logs can be retrieved within the container in the `/var/log/exegol/vpn.log` file.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to create a container that is able to start **VPN
> manually**, you can create your container with the following
> parameters: `exegol start --vpn ''`

### Shell logging

Within the framework of a mission, it is necessary to **log all
actions** performed during a pentest, red team etc. To meet this need,
Exegol has a feature to **automatically record everything** that is
displayed (stdout / stderr) but also all entries (stdin).

See the option `--log` of the [start action](./cli/start#options) to enable the feature.

> [!SUCCESS] Hint
> When the option is enabled upon **creation** of a new container, all
> shells created for this container **will be automatically logged**.
>
> If the container was created **without** this option, the shells can
> still be logged **individually** by adding the option in the **start**
> command of **each** shell.


The date and time of each command is displayed thanks to the PS1 of
`zsh`.

The logs are automatically saved in the `/workspace/logs` folder. Each
log file is **automatically compressed** with `gzip` at the end of the
session to optimize disk space. The automatic compression of log files
can be **disabled** manually with the [start action](./cli/start#options)

`--log-compress` parameter or change the default behavior in the
[Exegol configuration file](/wrapper/features#exegol-configuration).

> [!SUCCESS] Hint
> When the default configuration of the log compression is changed from
> the config file and the feature will be **disabled by default**, the
> option `--log-compress` can still be used to manually **enable** the
> feature in specific cases.


> [!WARNING]
> The logs should **NOT** be consulted from the exegol container but
> **from the host** to avoid loops and duplication of data in the logs.

There are (since exegol images version `3.0.0`) different methods of
shell logging. The shell logging method can be selected manually with
the [start action](./cli/start#options)
`--log-method` parameter or by
default in the [configuration file of Exegol](/wrapper/features#exegol-configuration).

:::tabs ::

=== asciinema (default)

The shell logging method **asciinema** is available from exegol images
version `3.0.0`. This new mode allows to consult sessions in **video**
format taking into account the interactive environment. It is also
possible to **manually upload** and **share** recordings, useful for
**demonstrations** for example

Here is a quick demonstration:

<Asciinema/>

To view/replay the logs from your host, you must **install** `asciinema` on your **host** machine.

> [!TIP]
> - Logs in `.gz` format can be replay directly **without unpacking** them with the command: `gunzip -c <filename_shell.asciinema.gz> | asciinema play -`
> - To display the whole session **without** the "video" mode, it is possible to use the command: `asciinema cat <filename_shell.asciinema>`
> - When you share or play an `asciinema` video, you can **copy** and **paste** any command/text it contains.


=== script  

**script** is the "classic" method of session logging, it was also the
only option available before version `3.0.0` of exegol images. This
method simply records **all** incoming (stdin) and outgoing
(stdout/stderr) shell actions in a file.

> [!TIP]
> Logs in `.gz` format can be viewed directly **without unpacking** them
> with the `zcat`, `zgrep`, `zdiff` or `zmore` command!

> [!WARNING]
> Shell logging saves **EVERYTHING** including keyboard shortcuts,
> display refreshes, etc.
>
> Complex graphical environments (such as tmux) can make it difficult to
> read the logs.

:::

### Network modes

By default, containers created by Exegol use the `host` network mode, which means that the **network interfaces** of the
host are **shared** with the container.

This configuration is useful to:

- dynamically open ports and services
- have a low level access on a physical network (some operation might need privileged mode)
- share a unique ip address on the target network
- share a MAC address on the target network (to be considered as a single physical machine)

> [!TIP]
> Even without ``host`` mode, ports can be exposed with parameter ``--port`` when creating a new container.

However, Exegol supports different network modes to suit various use cases:

- `host`: Container shares host's network interfaces, just like as a classic host process. Use for direct interface
  access, low-level operations, or sharing host IP/MAC.
- `docker`: Uses Docker's default bridge network where all containers (not just Exegol) share the same network space and
  can communicate with each other. Use for standard cases requiring basic network isolation and port control.
- `nat` : <Badge type="pro"/><Badge type="enterprise"/> Creates an isolated network with a dedicated /28 subnet (14 IP
  addresses available) for each container, providing complete isolation from other containers. Use for sensitive
  operations requiring dedicated network with isolation.
- `disable`: Blocks all network connectivity. Use for maximum isolation or offline operations.

See the `--network` option of the [start action](/wrapper/cli/start#network-modes) for more details.

> [!WARNING]
> Full sharing of host network interfaces is only possible on Linux.
>
> Adaptations of this mode exist on Windows and Mac with Docker Desktop or Orbstack, but there might be some *
*limitations**.

### Shared timezones

For convenience and precision in the date and time of the logs of each
command, exegol allows to share the timezone of the host in the
container.

This feature is active by default and can be disabled with the option
`--disable-shared-timezones` of the [start action](./cli/start#options).

### Exegol-resources

To save time and have at hand many tools, scripts and other resources,
exegol maintains a repository [exegol-resources](/resources/list)
contains many updated tools that are available to the host and exegol
containers.

This module is not mandatory and can be downloaded later.

> [!SUCCESS] Hint
> If an antivirus is present on your host, be careful to exclude the
> destination folder of the `exegol-resources` module before downloading
> it.

This feature is active and shared by default and can be disabled with
the option `--disable-exegol-resources` of the
[start action](./cli/start#options).

### My-resources

The my-resources feature is a space dedicated to the user and shared
with all the containers. This space allows to store configurations and
to install personal tools.

More details on the functionality of the wrapper
[here](/wrapper/features#my-resources) and how to take advantage of the customization system [`here`](/images/my-resources).

### Volume sharing

For specific needs, the exegol wrapper allows to add additional custom
volumes (type bind mounts) when creating an exegol container.

See the option `--volume VOLUMES` of the [`start action`](./cli/start#options) for more details.

### Port sharing

When the host network is not shared, it is still possible to **publish**
specific ports to expose **services** or **port** ranges.

> [!SUCCESS] Hint
> This configuration is **compatible** even with installations based on
> Docker Desktop.

This feature allows the user to select:

- a specific network interface (for example 127.0.0.1) or by default all
  interfaces (0.0.0.0).
- the port to open on the host interface.
- the destination port to be linked in the container.
- the protocol to use, docker supports `TCP`, `UDP` and `SCTP` protocols
  (default is TCP).

See the option `--port PORTS` of the [start action](./cli/start#options) for more details.

### Env. variables

Exegol can configure custom environment variables defined by the user.

When the environment variables are defined at the first time of the
container creation, these variables will be:

- accessible in the container by all processes
- present during the whole lifetime of the container

The environment variables can be defined when opening a shell in an
**existing** container and will be available **only** in the user's
shell until it is closed.

See the option `--env ENVS` of the [start action](./cli/start#options) for more details.

### Device sharing

For the needs of some applications running on physical hardware (such as
proxmark3), exegol can supply the container with one or more physical
devices.

See the option `--device DEVICES` of the [start action](./cli/start#options) for more details.

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is only available on **Linux** installations!
>
> Windows and MacOS installations are subject to the constraints and
> limitations of [Docker
> Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/#can-i-pass-through-a-usb-device-to-a-container).

> [!WARNING]
> Docker only load shared device at container **startup**. If you have
> to unplug / plug again your device it might **no longer works** until
> you **restart** the container with `exegol restart <container_name>`.
>
> This bug occurs even if the `/dev/ttyACM0` device is still present in
> your container.

### Custom hostname

In some environments with OPSEC requirements, it may be necessary to
change the hostname of your exegol container.

See the option `--hostname HOSTNAME` of the
[start action](./cli/start#options) for more details.

### Comments

To add more context information about an exegol container, it is
possible to add **comments** to each Exegol container. The comment of an
exegol container can be displayed with the command
`exegol info <container_name>`

See the option `--comment COMMENT` of the [start action](./cli/start#options) for more details.

### Capabilities

Exegol supports adding **Linux capabilities** to the Exegol
**container** to perform tasks that require **administrative** rights
**without** allowing everything.

This feature gives control to the user to configure his container but
giving administrator rights remains a dangerous practice and should be
used by experienced users only.

For more details on the capabilities supported by docker [check
here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities).

> [!WARNING]
> Not all Linux capabilities are allowed by the Exegol wrapper, here is
> the list of available capabilities:
>
> `NET_ADMIN`, `NET_BROADCAST`, `SYS_MODULE`, `SYS_PTRACE`, `SYS_RAWIO`,
> `SYS_ADMIN`, `LINUX_IMMUTABLE`, `MAC_ADMIN`, `SYSLOG`
>
> For all other needs, consider the [privileged](/wrapper/features#privileged)
> mode.

### Privileged

For particular needs, it is sometimes necessary to have **privileged
rights** to perform certain actions. If Exegol does **not** allow you to
have specifically the rights necessary, you can configure your container
in privileged mode to get **full administrator rights**.

> [!WARNING]
> This configuration is particularly **dangerous** because it gives the
> container **full admin control** over the **kernel** of the **host**
> machine.
>
> Use this option **only** if you know **exactly** what you are doing!!
>
> If the need is specifically identified, consider adding
> [capabilities](/wrapper/features#capabilities) instead!

See the option `--privileged` of the [start action](./cli/start#options) for more details.

### Multi-architecture

Exegol supports `ARM64` architecture (in addition to the classic
`AMD64`) since version `4.1.0` of the wrapper and `3.0.0` of the images.

This support allows you to fully use exegol on hardware equipped with an
**ARM** processor (such as Mac M1 / M2 but also some Raspberry Pi).

> [!WARNING]
> Exegol only supports **64-bit ARM** architecture! If your ARM
> processor supports 64-bit, make sure your **OS** is also installed in
> **64-bit version** to use exegol!

> [!TIP]
> For experienced users or developers, it is possible to explicitly
> modify the architecture used by the Exegol wrapper with the
> [general option](/wrapper/cli/version#general-options) `--arch ARCH`.
>
> But be **careful**, the modification of this parameter can lead to
> **malfunctions**!

### Local image building

The wrapper allows users to build custom Exegol images locally. This feature is useful for:

- Customizing the image with specific tools or configurations
- Building for a different architecture than your host
- Testing new features or modifications

> [!WARNING]
> Building images locally can be challenging and time-consuming. We recommend using pre-built images (`exegol install`)
> unless you have a specific need to build locally.

See the [build action](/wrapper/cli/build) for detailed usage and options.

### Remote image pulling

To save time, pre-built images are available for download. These images can be downloaded and installed / updated from
the exegol wrapper with the [install](/wrapper/cli/install) and [update](/wrapper/cli/update) actions.

### Custom images <Badge type="new"/><Badge type="enterprise"/>

Enterprise users can configure custom image names to be recognized by Exegol. This configuration allows the wrapper to
identify and work with Exegol images that have different names than the official ones. Useful for sharing customized
images with your team through a private registry.

To configure custom images, add them to your [Exegol configuration file](/wrapper/configuration#configuration-file):

Note that images must be pulled manually as they may be in private registries requiring specific authentication.

### Custom registry <Badge type="new"/><Badge type="enterprise"/>

For organizations requiring a complete private registry solution, we offer a managed Exegol private registry service.
This enterprise solution includes:

- A fully managed private Docker registry for Exegol images
- Custom Exegol images maintained and updated by our team
- Full integration with the Exegol wrapper
- Automatic updates and maintenance of your private images
- Dedicated support and customization options
- The appropriate NDA and IP agreements, to protect your knowledge and content

This service is ideal for organizations that need:

- Complete control over their Exegol image distribution
- Private, organization-specific Exegol images
- Full integration with their existing infrastructure
- Regular updates and maintenance of their private images

Contact us for a quote and to discuss your organization's specific requirements.

### Command execution

The Exegol wrapper does not only allow the opening of interactive
shells, it is also possible to execute **single commands** in several
ways.

> [!TIP]
> To see the execution logs of the command, the user must add the
> parameter `-v`.

The details of this functionality are detailed in the
[exec](./cli/exec#exec-options) action.

#### Daemon execution

One of the execution modes can be in the **background** like a daemon
service. In this way the wrapper executes the **user's command**, for
example an application such as bloodhound. The wrapper **launches** the
task in an exegol container and **finishes immediately** without
occupying the user's terminal, leaving the application **open**.

See the option `--background` of the [exec action](./cli/exec#exec-options) for more details.

#### Temporary containers

Another feature of the [exec](./cli/exec) action is the
execution in a **temporary** container.

In this mode, a **temporary** container will be created and
**dedicated** to the execution of the command specified by the user.

This mode can be useful to run a given command with the most
**up-to-date** image already installed on the host, for any **test** or
for special **privacy** needs.

See the option `--tmp` of the [exec](./cli/exec#exec-options) for more details.
