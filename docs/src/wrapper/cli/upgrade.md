# `upgrade` action <Badge type="pro"/> <Badge type="enterprise"/>

The exegol wrapper has an `upgrade` action dedicated to upgrade 
one or multiple containers from an outdated image to a more recent one.
Installing or updating an image can be done with the [install](/wrapper/cli/install) and [update](/wrapper/cli/update) actions.

The principle of the upgrade function is to automate all the tasks involved 
in recreating a new container with a new image:
1. The container will first be started, and the data listed below will be **saved**.
2. The container will then be **renamed** as a backup (or **deleted** and all unsaved data outside the workspace will be **permanently deleted**).
3. A new container will be created with the **same configuration** and the **same name**
4. All previously saved data will be **restored** in the new container.

> [!IMPORTANT] Backups
> When the outdated container is kept as a backup, the original container is **renamed** by appending `-bak`. 
> 
> It will be deleted together with the new upgraded container when using the [remove](wrapper/cli/remove) option.

## Data transferred during upgrade

The following data will migrate to the new upgraded container:
- Your [my-resources](images/my-resources) customization
- The container `/workspace` directory
- The **Zsh** and **Bash** command history
- (From Exegol images `3.1.8`) The [exegol-history](images/exegol-history) database
- The [TriliumNext](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium) notes database
- The following files:
  - `/etc/hosts`
  - `/etc/resolv.conf`
  - `/opt/tools/Exegol-history/profile.sh`
- The configuration of the following tools: 
  - [Proxychains](https://github.com/haad/proxychains)
