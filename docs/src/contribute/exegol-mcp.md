# Contributing to Exegol MCP

Exegol MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants and agents to interact with Exegol. This service allows AI clients (such as Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) to use Exegol and work on offensive security tasks such as Capture The Flag, penetration testing, etc. 

For more information about using the tool, see the [Exegol MCP documentation](/mcp/features).
