# Installing Exegol on Fedora

> [!NOTE]

Exegol is installed through two main steps:

1. Install the Python wrapper (the "brains")
2. Install at least one Exegol image (the "muscle")

## 1. Requirements

Git, Python3 and Pipx can be installed with the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf -y update && sudo dnf -y install git python3 pipx
```

Ensure pipx is in PATH and reload the shell

```bash
pipx ensurepath && exec $SHELL
```

While we always advise to refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), the following one-liner can be used to install Docker quickly.

```bash
curl -fsSL "https://get.docker.com/" | sh
```

> [!WARNING]
> Docker "[Rootless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)" is not supported by Exegol as of yet. Don't follow that part.

Once docker is installed, it needs to be started.

```bash
# start docker
sudo systemctl start docker

# configure docker to start at boot
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

## 2. Wrapper install

Install Exegol in an isolated environment using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), a tool that allows you to easily install and run Python applications in isolated environments, keeping them separate from your system Python and other packages.

```bash
pipx install exegol
```

Before using Exegol, you will need to read and accept the [End User License Agreement (EULA)](/legal/eula). This will be prompted on the first run of the wrapper, and until it's confirmed.

To interact with docker, the wrapper needs proper permissions. You must either run Exegol with sudo (preferred), or have your user be a member of the docker group (which dangerously allows your user to basically have root permissions all the time).

Check your current shell by running `echo $SHELL`, then apply the commands for the matching shell accordingly.

:::tabs ::

=== Bash

Add the following alias to your `~/.bashrc` file by running the following command:

```bash
echo "alias exegol='sudo -E \$HOME/.local/bin/exegol'" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

=== Zsh

Add the following alias to your `~/.zshrc` file by running the following command:

```bash
echo "alias exegol='sudo -E \$HOME/.local/bin/exegol'" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
```

## 3. The rest

Once the requirements are installed, the main installation documentation can be followed, from [step "3. Activation"](/first-install#_3-activation).
