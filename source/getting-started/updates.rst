Updates
=======

The whole Exegol can be updated through its own wrapper with ``exegol update`` (documentation
:doc:`here </exegol-wrapper/update>`).

.. hint::

   Wrappers installed with pip don't support auto-update. The wrapper itself can then can be updated as follows.

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 -m pip install --upgrade exegol
