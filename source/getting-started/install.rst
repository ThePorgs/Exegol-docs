Install Exegol
==============

Installing Exegol starts with installing the entrypoint to the whole project: the Python wrapper. Once the wrapper is installed, everything else can be managed from it.

.. hint::

   It is strongly advised to install Exegol on a Linux host, especially when planning on using Exegol for internal penetration tests. This is because Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS lacks a few features, mainly due to how these operating systems run Docker containers within an internal VM that doesn't share the host's network interfaces and USB accessories.

Once the wrapper is installed, the second step in setting up Exegol on a device is to install at least one Exegol image, either with ``exegol start`` (documentation
:doc:`here </exegol-wrapper/start>`), or with ``exegol install`` (documentation
:doc:`here </exegol-wrapper/install>`). Both actions will guide the user in installing an image if needed.

Requirements
============

The following elements are required before Exegol can be installed, whatever the host's operating system is:

* git (`Linux <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-linux>`__ | `macOS <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-mac>`__ | `Windows <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-windows>`__)
* python3 (`Linux <https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#on-linux>`__ | `macOS <https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/>`__ | `Windows <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`__)
* docker (`Linux <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/>`__) or Docker Desktop (`macOS <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/>`__ | `Windows <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/>`__)
* at least 100GB of free storage recommended (a minimum of 20GB could be enough, but only for the ``light`` image).

Additional dependencies may be required depending on the host OS.

..  tabs::

    ..  group-tab:: Linux

        No additional dependencies for Linux environments.

        .. tip::

           From Linux systems, Docker can be installed quickly and easily with the following command-line:

           .. code-block:: bash

              curl -fsSL "https://get.docker.com/" | sh

        .. warning::

           By default, ``sudo`` will be required when running docker, hence needed as well for Exegol. For security reasons, it should stay that way, but it's possible to change that. In order to run exegol from the user environment without ``sudo``, the user must have the appropriate rights. You can use the following command to grant them to the current user:

           .. code-block:: bash

              # add the sudo group to the user
              sudo usermod -aG docker $(id -u -n)

              # "reload" the user groups with the newly added docker group
              newgrp docker

           For more information, official Docker documentation shows `how to manage docker as a non root user <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-userm>`_.

        .. warning::

            `Docker "Rootless mode" <https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/>`_ is not supported by Exegol as of yet. Please follow the install procedure mentionned above.

    ..  group-tab:: macOS

        To support graphical applications (:ref:`display sharing functionality <feature_x11_sharing>`, e.g. Bloodhound, Wireshark, Burp, etc.), additional dependencies and configuration are required:

        .. hint::

            The XQuartz requirement below is now optional if using the (beta) :ref:`Graphical Remote Desktop feature <feature_desktop>` instead of X11 sharing (join our Discord to know more about this beta feature).

        * `XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org/>`__ must be installed
        * The XQuartz config ``Allow connections from network clients`` must be set to true
        * Docker Desktop must be configured with default File Sharing (see screenshot below)

        .. warning::

            You'll also need to add the exegol source folder (or, more precisely, the folder ``[...]/exegol/utils/imgsync``).

            If you install Exegol from the python pip package, this folder is located where the python packages are installed.
            The path to this folder depends on how you installed python. When creating your first container, you may get an error disclosing the exegol installation folder, which will have to be added as an authorized resource.

            By default, you can try to add the path: ``/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework`` to the Docker Desktop File sharing allowlist.


        .. tip::

            `OrbStack <https://orbstack.dev/>`__ for **Mac** is supported by Exegol wrapper from ``v4.2.0``.

            Your exegol installation cannot be stored under ``/opt`` directory when using OrbStack (`due to OrbStack limitations <https://github.com/orbstack/orbstack/issues/435>`_).

            This support is still in beta, feel free to open issues on `GitHub <https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol/issues/new/choose>`__ if you encounter any bugs.

    ..  group-tab:: Windows

        To support graphical applications (:ref:`display sharing functionality <feature_x11_sharing>`, e.g. Bloodhound, Wireshark, Burp, etc.), additional dependencies and configuration are required:

        * Windows **10** (up to date), or Windows **11**, is required
        * **Docker Desktop** installed on the Windows host
        * Docker Desktop must be configured to run on **WSL2** engine (`how to <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_)
        * `WSLg <https://github.com/microsoft/wslg#installing-wslg>`_ must be installed to support graphical application
        * at least one WSL distribution must be **installed** as well (e.g. Debian), with **Docker integration** enabled (see screenshot below)

            Windows Docker Desktop WSL integration configuration

        In a Windows environment, the Exegol wrapper can be installed **either** in a **WSL shell** or directly in your Windows environment with **Powershell**.

        .. warning::

            Please note that it is **not** advisable to use Exegol from both environments at the same time, as this could lead to conflicts and Exegol does not officially support this configuration.

        .. warning::

            You may want to disable Windows Defender during the installation, as Exegol will download pre-built remote shells (or temporarily exclude ``C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp`` or the source file directory).

            You should also add the folder ``C:\Users\<user>\.exegol\exegol-resources`` to the exclusion list.


.. _exegol_install:

Installation
============

The installation of Exegol on Linux, macOS and Windows are very similar. It can either be installed from pip (easiest, most user-friendly, but with a few missing features) or from sources (easy as well, fully featured).


1. Installation of exegol
-------------------------

..  tabs::
    ..  group-tab:: Installing with pipx (preferred)

        The pre-compiled Exegol’s wrapper can be installed from the PyPI repository.
        While this is the easiest and most user-friendly technique, it is advised to install from sources, as it allows to switch from release to dev branches easily and it supports the auto-update feature.

        Using ``pipx`` allows you to install Exegol in an **isolated** virtual environment **dedicated** to it.

        First, ``pipx`` must be installed on your host system:

        .. code-block:: bash

            # install pipx if not already installed, from system package:
            sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx
            # OR from pip
            python3 -m pip install pipx

        Exegol's wrapper can be installed with ``pipx`` from **PyPI**:

        .. code-block:: bash

            # You can now install Exegol package from PyPI
            pipx install exegol

..  group-tab:: Installing with uv

        The pre-compiled Exegol’s wrapper can be installed from the PyPI repository.
        While this is the easiest and most user-friendly technique, it is advised to install from sources, as it allows to switch from release to dev branches easily and it supports the auto-update feature.

        Using ``uv`` allows you to install Exegol in an **isolated** virtual environment **dedicated** to it.

        First, ``uv`` must be installed on your host system:

        .. code-block:: bash

            # install uv if not already installed:
            curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
            # OR from pip
            python3 -m pip install uv
            # OR https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

        Exegol's wrapper can be installed with ``uv tool`` from **PyPI**:

        .. code-block:: bash

            # You can now install Exegol package from PyPI
            uv tool install exegol

    ..  group-tab:: Installing from sources

        Exegol's wrapper can be installed from sources (with Git). The wrapper then knows how to self-update, and switching from release and development branches is possible and very easy.

        .. code-block:: bash

            git clone "https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol"

        .. tip::

           If you want a **light** clone of Exegol (and **never** use the **dev** branch), you can use the following command:

           .. code-block:: bash

               git clone --shallow-since="2023/05/08" "https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol"

        If you have access to docker directly as a user, you can install the requirements only for your current user
        otherwise the requirements must be installed as root to run Exegol with sudo.

        .. tabs::

           .. tab:: With sudo

               .. code-block:: bash

                  sudo python3 -m pip install --requirement "Exegol/requirements.txt"

           .. tab:: Directly as user

               .. code-block:: bash

                  python3 -m pip install --user --requirement "Exegol/requirements.txt"

    ..  group-tab:: Installing with pip

        The pre-compiled Exegol’s wrapper can be installed from the PyPI repository.
        While this is the easiest and most user-friendly technique, it is advised to install from sources, as it allows to switch from release to dev branches easily and it supports the auto-update feature.

        .. code-block:: bash

           python3 -m pip install exegol

        .. warning::

            In some cases, it is no longer possible to add a pip package system-wide (PEP 668). In such cases, it is preferable to use ``pipx``.


2. Adding Exegol to the ``PATH``
--------------------------------

..  tabs::

    ..  group-tab:: Installing with pipx (preferred)

        In order to use pipx applications, the pipx environment must be set in your PATH:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pipx ensurepath

        Dont forget to open a **new terminal** to reload your PATH before continuing.

    ..  group-tab:: Installing with uv

        ``uv tool`` automatically adds the application to PATH.

    ..  group-tab:: Installing from sources

        ..  tabs::
            .. tab:: Linux & MacOS

                Once this is taken care of, the exegol wrapper can then be added to the ``PATH`` with a symlink for direct access. This allows to call exegol from wherever, instead of to use the absolute path. Exegol can then be used with ``exegol <action>`` instead of ``python3 /path/to/Exegol/exegol.py <action>``.

                .. code-block:: bash

                   sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/Exegol/exegol.py" "/usr/local/bin/exegol"

            ..  group-tab:: Windows

                Once this is taken care of, the exegol wrapper can then can be added as a PowerShell command alias. Exegol can then be used with ``exegol <action>`` instead of ``python3 /path/to/Exegol/exegol.py <action>``.

                To create the alias file correctly, open a PowerShell and place yourself in the folder where exegol is located (applicable only for `from source` installations) and run the following commands:

                Create `$PROFILE` file if it doesn't exist:

                .. code-block:: powershell

                    if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
                        New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
                    }

                Create alias for Exegol in `$PROFILE`:

                .. code-block:: powershell

                    echo "Set-Alias -Name exegol -Value '$(pwd)\exegol.py'" >> $PROFILE

                .. warning::

                   To automatically load aliases from the ``.ps1`` file, PowerShell's ``Get-ExecutionPolicy`` must be set to ``RemoteSigned``.

                   If the configuration is not correct it can be configured as **administrator** with the following command:

                   .. code-block:: powershell

                      Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

                .. tip::
                    If you have installed Python3 manually and Windows opens the **Microsoft store** on the python page as soon as you type ``python3.exe``, try this:

                    It is possible to disable this behavior in the Windows settings: ``Apps > Apps & features > App execution aliases`` and disable aliases for ``python.exe`` and ``python3.exe``.

    ..  group-tab:: Installing with pip

        If your pip installation is correct and functional, you have nothing more to do and you can already use the command ``exegol``.

        If not, remember that pip installs binaries in a **dedicated** local folder, which then **must** be in the ``PATH`` environment variable.

.. _install_exegol_privileges:

3. Run Exegol with appropriate privileges
-----------------------------------------


..  tabs::

    ..  group-tab:: Linux

        Exegol does not support rootless docker. To interact with docker, you must either have your user be a member of the docker group to use exegol as a user, or run Exegol with root privileges using sudo.

        ..  tabs::

            .. tab:: Run as root (preferred)

                To run Exegol as root with sudo, you must use a specific sudo command. For a better user experience, we recommend using an alias:

                ..  tabs::

                    .. group-tab:: Bash

                        .. code-block:: bash

                            echo "alias exegol='sudo -E $(which exegol)'" >> ~/.bash_aliases
                            source ~/.bashrc

                    .. group-tab:: Zsh

                        .. code-block:: bash

                            echo "alias exegol='sudo -E $(which exegol)'" >> ~/.zshrc
                            source ~/.zshrc

                    .. group-tab:: Fish

                        .. code-block:: bash

                            alias exegol='sudo -E $(which exegol)' --save

                    .. tip::distribution

                        Please note that on most Linux distros, .bash_aliases is included in .bashrc. However, this is not the case in some distributions (i.e. Arch Linux). If this is your case, it is recommended to include .bash_aliases in .bashrc by adding these lines in your .bashrc file (for more details, please follow the documentation of your Linux distribution): 

                        .. code-block:: bash

                            if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
                                . ~/.bash_aliases
                            fi

            .. tab:: Run as user

                .. warning::

                    By giving the user direct access to docker, this allows the user to compromise the host and become **root** on the machine with full access to the file system.

                    For more information, official Docker documentation shows `how to manage docker as a non root user <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-userm>`_.

                If you accept this risk because the environment is not critical and you prefer ease of use without the security control provided by sudo, you can apply the following method to use exegol directly as a user:

               .. code-block:: bash

                    # add the sudo group to the user
                    sudo usermod -aG docker $(id -u -n)

                    # To apply the new group you must open a new shell
                    exit
                    # OR "reload" the user groups with the newly added docker group
                    newgrp docker

    ..  group-tab:: macOS

        Exegol should **NOT** be used as root on macOS. Docker Desktop (or Orbstack) do not require root privileges.

    ..  group-tab:: Windows

        Exegol should **NOT** be used as admin on Windows and **NOT** as root in a WSL instance. Docker Desktop doesn't require administrator privileges.


4. Installation of the first Exegol image
-----------------------------------------

Once the exegol wrapper is installed, you can download your first docker image with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   exegol install


5. (Optional) Using Exegol auto-completion
------------------------------------------

Exegol (wrapper) supports auto-completion in many shell environments but there is a configuration to add (on the host) for this feature to work.

.. important::

    The following configurations must be made in your **host** environment.

.. tip::

    If the command ``register-python-argcomplete`` is not found on your host, you have to install it:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Using the system package manager
        sudo apt install python3-argcomplete

        # Or using pip (check if pip packages are included in your $PATH)
        pip3 install --user argcomplete

        # Or using pipx (check if pipx packages are included in your $PATH)
        pipx install argcomplete

        # Or using uv
        uv tool install argcomplete

..  tabs::
    ..  tabs::
        .. group-tab:: Bash

            You can enable Exegol auto-completion for your **current user** with your ``.bashrc`` or you can enable the auto-completion **system-wide** with ``bash-completion``.

            ..  tabs::

                .. tab:: Via bash-completion

                    To setup the auto-completion system-wide you first need to install ``bash-completion`` on your system (if not already installed).

                    .. code-block:: bash

                        sudo apt update && sudo apt install bash-completion

                    At this point you should have a ``/etc/bash_completion.d/`` folder. It's in there that you can add any auto-completion module that you want.

                    To generate and install the exegol completion configuration you can execute the following command with ``register-python-argcomplete``:

                    .. code-block:: bash

                        register-python-argcomplete --no-defaults exegol | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/exegol > /dev/null

                .. tab:: Via .bashrc

                    Add the following command in your ``~/.bashrc`` config:

                    .. code-block:: bash

                        eval "$(register-python-argcomplete --no-defaults exegol)"


            .. tip::
                If you have multiple tools using ``argcomplete`` you can also use the `global completion <https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/#global-completion>`__ method (need bash >= 4.2).

        .. group-tab:: Zsh

            To activate completions for zsh you need to have ``compinit`` enabled in zsh:

            .. code-block:: bash

                autoload -U compinit
                compinit

            Afterwards you can enable completion by adding the following command in your ``~/.zshrc`` config:

            .. code-block:: bash

                eval "$(register-python-argcomplete --no-defaults exegol)"

        .. group-tab:: Fish

            To activate completions for fish use:

            .. code-block:: bash

                register-python-argcomplete --no-defaults --shell fish exegol | source

            or create new completion file, e.g:

            .. code-block:: bash

                register-python-argcomplete --no-defaults --shell fish exegol > ~/.config/fish/completions/exegol.fish

        .. group-tab:: Tcsh

            To activate completions for tcsh use:

            .. code-block:: bash

                eval `register-python-argcomplete --no-defaults --shell tcsh exegol`

        .. tab:: PowerShell

            To activate completions for PowerShell, first generate completion file :

            .. code-block:: powershell

                register-python-argcomplete --no-defaults --shell powershell exegol > $HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\exegol_completion.psm1

            .. warning::

                If the command ``register-python-argcomplete`` is not found, that means that python pip script are not in your PATH.
